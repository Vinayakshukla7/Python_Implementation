       "  'rating': 4.0,\n",
       "  'body': 'Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it\\'s hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let\\'s look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩\\xa0🇪\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇬\\xa0🇳\\xa0Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain \"cool\" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I\\'m touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇵\\xa0🇱\\xa0🇦\\xa0🇾\\xa0The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone\\'s fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we\\'ve seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That\\'s slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don\\'t get fooled, it\\'s merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.'},\n",

One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.\"},\n",

Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging.

The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy\"},\n",

One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.\"},\n",
