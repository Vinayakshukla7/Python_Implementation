Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.\"},\n",

It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use.

But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.\"},\n",

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.\"},\n",

With good specs on paper available at the then low price of Rs 9000 I made a greed-fueled decision to go for this. After 3 months I find the glass has scratched all too easily (as opposed to my Lenovo smartphone), the MIUI OS is buggy as hell and the gyroscope just does not work so moving the phone around does not change the orientation in GPS maps (or games). Overall a pathetic device.\"},\n",

I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐'},\n",

I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day❗Moral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier 🙏\"},\n",

Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions.

Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).\"},\n",

This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre.

And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details.

So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written \"Warrenty Card is not given\" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you.'},\n",

I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me.

       "  'Review': \"I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.\"},\n",

This phone is really having a big screen for first time smartphone buyers.3)Fast face unlock. This is quite really amazing feature where you can quickly unlock your phone. It also unlocks even if you wear mask on face.4)Better processor. It works well with some apps being used simultaneously.5)Fast Charging. It charge fast (not very fast) when compare to other phones with less than 10K. It gets charge around 1 hour.6)Good speaker. Speaker is loud.7)Don't get heat up. Surprisingly, being a Redmi phone, this doesn't get hot that much :)8)Selfie Camera is good. Back cameras are also good but not great. Work well in daylight outside or in functions in nights.Random images may be bad but you need to tap focus, turn on flashlight and take pictures without shaking.Cons :1)Little Heavy.2)Display is not full HD or AMOLED but looks not so bad.3)Not for high end gamers.4)Volume adjustment often doesn't work. It's shocking that sometimes volume get really high and unable to set to low quickly.. it increase or gets decrease automatically. I'm confused why this issue exists on the device.5)WIFI Calling has some issues but works well with normal calling.6)Lack fingerprint scanner. You can unlock using face scanning.7)Phone WIFI takes longer time to be connected.8)Internal Memory filled up soon, makes apps shut down and you cannot transfer installed apps to SD card.9)You can see some bugs in MIUI even if its updated to MIUI 12+. I could see slowness, apps auto shutdown, auto restart etc.Conclusion : If you just want a tough phone which lasts 1.5 days and have all necessary features and you don't have habit of showing off to other friends then this phone is perfect for you.If you want a high end phone which can play heavy games faster and do multiple tasks simultaneously and have a crisp clear camera and very fast charging then this phone is not for you. You can invest little further and buy another one.Thank you!\"},\n",

Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.\"},\n",

Not just this but any Mi phone.They replaces every single piece of app (even the basic apps like clock and calculator) and asks to use internet and provide conscent to privacy policy.God knows why they need to replace such basic app and why these apps need to use internet. I denied the permissions and result - Phone restarting abruptly. Can't even start the phone in safe mode. Same thing.My first Mi phone and I know for sure this is last. Never buying another mi phone and will try and get rid of this as soon as possible.Crossed the 7 day return period and not I am stuck with this plastic piece of garbage.Want to buy a phone, buy one which has stock or near to stock android, gets the most out of same hardware in terms of performance.\"},\n",

Big Display (This 6\\'22\" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn\\'t have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.'},\n",

The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy\"},\n",

However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide\\'s sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0\" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren\\'t many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that\\'s pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can\\'t see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.'},\n",

I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down.\"},\n",

The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos.\"},\n",

Camera quality is just awesome.If I was to say about the battery, I would like to mention that it doesn't gives much backup. It drains faster. By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ℅ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10℅ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100℅.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.☹️\"},\n",

One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.\"},\n",

I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐'},\n",

I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#.

Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance.'},\n",

Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.\"},\n",

For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.\"},\n",

This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre.

Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.\"},\n",

I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me.

       "  'Review': \"I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.\"},\n",

Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range.\"},\n",

Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.\"},\n",

Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐'},\n",

Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer..

Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Using this phone since a month and some of the key features are missing and facing other issues with MIUI12.Pros:  1)Good battery backup, but charging from 95% to 100% will take longer in the end.  2)Non-slippery and sturdy build quality  3)Comes with pre-applied screen guard which is still working fine.  4)Good sound qualityCons:  1)There is no Notification light, when you are charging there is no indication that it is even charging or fully charged.2) There is no notification light for any alerts which you receive, when you keep the phone for charging or when you receive any sms, missed calls, etc. You will have to unlock the phone and check the notifications.3) The camera quality is OK. You will have to learn how to use quad cameras properly via youtube videos.4) When you enable FingerPrint, Password lock, then Google backup stops working. This is major issue in this phone.5) The local MIUI backup for call history, sms history  doesn't work at all and it fails continuously. I showed it to the MI retailer shop and also to the customer care, even after 2 factory resets, this feature doesn't work. The only way to backup call history, sms history is via Google backup. But for google backup to work you have to disable Fingerprint lock. So, overall a bad backup experience in the current MIUI 12.0.6.06) Comes with lots of un-removable MIUI bloatware. I removed them manually via XDA tool on PC, apps like MiPay, MiCloud, Wellbeing, Mi Credit, Facebook, etc. A non-technical user or elders will have to live with all the bloatware of MIUI which shares your personal data with external applications by default. Better to watch some tips and tricks online and disable them.\"},\n",

Cons are so frustrating that amazon have now blocked giving direct reviews of this phone it seems. only genuine buyers can review it.pros:dual speaker, HD clarity on netflix n amazon primecons:1.camera takes literally 7secs to open (before installing extra apps on mobile itself),2.if u open netflix etc forget that it opens any other app without 10secs lag. so horrible i have never seen.3.third point is camera quality.. please don't buy seeing details on paper for this phone.4.memory management is so horrible that any app u open n switch to other app even for 3secs,it'll close old app i mean MIUI will literally kill ur apps so that you have to wait for double lag on ur screen.Last mobile I bought from xaiomi. it broke the real fans with this mobile basically.6.lastly, it doesn't have notification light which exists in 4year old phones from redmi series.verdict is.. just don't get into trap seeing details and numbers of this phone. it can't even handle basic functionalities without lag. maybe MIUI 12 is too bulky on this worthless piece.\"},\n",

It easy survived for more than 40 hours after using some basic apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Prime Video and Spotify.Software:--The UI seems good, except some apps which keeps crashing every time. (Requires a software update to avoid that)--Experienced no Lag when switching between apps or while using apps.Over all this is a good device at this price range. Definitely not recommended if you use many apps and install heavy games, as many apps crash while using. Can gift it to parents who doesn't use many apps or can be used as a secondary mobile phone.\"},\n",

In low light it is just can not be explained. 48MP camera is vague word.2) If you mangae to click one, the colours are over saturated. For taking good image one has to adjust everything.

I just can't believe that I got this phone at such a great price. 48 MP Quad cam setup is extremely powerful to get those crystal clear photos with sharp quality. 6000 mAh battery literally stays for 1-2 days even after extreme usage and 2-3 if we use only for calling and WhatsApp and with the 18W charger in the box is amazing as it just takes much less time compared to its battery lifespan. The speakers are much louder and sound like a home theater. The processor is awesome for gaming on medium graphics and good for high graphics for sometime. The gorilla glass is literally hard like a gorilla because I just mistakely dropped my phone 1-2 times from a human height without case and screen guard then too not a single scratch appeared.

Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks\"},\n",

Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging.

I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day❗Moral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier 🙏\"},\n",

SO IF YOU\\'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!'},\n",

Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone.

       "  'Review': \"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.🎯DESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.🎯PERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.🎯CAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.🎯VERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"PROS+ Truly fantastic display. Redmi has really given us a premium AMOLED panel with the Note 10. The darker colors are deep and feels HDRish+ Netflix / Prime Video content genuinely looks super ultra HD ( BEST ) thanks to the widevine certification.+ The whole front of the phone is a display unit except for the micro front cam punch hole.+ Phone feels extremely light in hands.+ Dual stereo speakers surprisingly offers great experience for casual youtubing and OTTs.  \\u200bCONS- Advertisements, ADS ADS spilled all over the UI with the MI apps pre installed. You all are gonna be having a really hard time trying to disable the ads or probably unsee them.- Super lengthy phone. Not really sure if the world is actually preferring only larger phones. The 4.5 inches display is not even a thing anymore sadly. Hence forget about using this one handed.- If you are a GAMER, AVOID the Note 10. The GPU struggles to do even 20 fps on Asphalt 9.- You are in for a nasty surprise if you bought this phone with a belief that it has better cameras. . The megapixel count game continues to be a gimmick.  Below average cameras.- Build Quality isn't that great. I don't think this phone may survive a fall damage.VERDICTThe budget series is back with a slightly increased price sadly. But the Display of the phone truly makes it up for the higher price and few cons. Lack in tough competition in this budget segment makes this phone a better choice. So decide yourself lol.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Well, I've been using this mobile for 3 weeks. I've used it as a moderate user with 30 minutes of gameplay (Genshin Impact), 3 hours of video watching, 30 minutes of web browsing, article reading & so forth per day. I'll divide the review in various aspects for better understanding.1. CPU, RAM & Storage : Very good on paper & quite snappy performance on real life too. Snapdragon 678 is a good processor. Never felt lack of RAM for daily usage. Apps also open quickly (more explained later on software part)2. Camera : Moderate. That's the exact word to describe it. I've seen better results from Sony IMX582. This can be improved by software update (more explained later on software part)3. Display : Moderate S-AMOLED display. Nothing extra ordinary but you can't really complain as per this price point. Viewing angle is good & display looks good too. Media consumption experience was good.4. Battery : Excellent. A full charge can go upto 1.5 days after all those activities.5. Speaker : Stereo speaker but not very loud. Bottom speaker is more louder than upper one. Not a deal breaker but it should be mentioned.6. UI / Software : PATHETIC. That's the only word I can say about MIUI 12. Except a couple of good things, the entire software is full of bugs. Let me list them down :a) Frequent disappearance of status bar & navigation buttons. You need to lock & unlock the phone to bring them back. (7-8 times per day)b) Connecting to a video call takes ages to be visible to other person. Also if you are in a video call, then you won't be able to switch back to audio call. You need to request the opposite person to switch it back from their end.c) Animations are taking too much time. From unlocking the phone to opening an app, there is a significant delay can be seen. That makes the general usage experience bad.d) Apps are opening & closing by itself. Although it's not very frequent but this happens.e) As per the sensor size in the camera, the end result should be much better. I felt that MIUI is dragging the photo quality down.f) If you put a call on hold them you won't be able to unhold / resume the call. You need to cut the call.** XIAOMI, YOU SHOULD REALLY WORK ON SOFTWARE SOON.7. Miscellaneous : Haptic feedback is good in this price. After 30 minutes of gaming season, the heat felts uncomfortable even though the back is plastic & the TPU case on it (although Genshin is very resource heavy game). There is no delay in audio feedback on bluetooth headsets. ADs are minimum if you disable personalized options.Final verdict : If XIAOMI provides us a good, bug-free software, then this the best mobile you can buy in Rs. 12000.\"},\n",

But, I recommend you to apply a Tempered glass for safety.DUAL SPEAKERS are super just for Multimedia. You can't expect to detect enemies footsteps by hearing from these speakers in pubg,codm and ff. When you hold your phone while gaming, YOUR HAND BLOCKS ONE SPEAKER... which is disturbing.GAMING : In terms of gaming, it can play 40 fps in pubg and codm without any lag. For freefire, it is one of the best. I didn't see any lags in ff. And it lagged with screen recording in codm( for ff, I didn't see any lag). SLIGHT HEATING will be seen which is not over heating. So, for heavy gamers, it is not better, but good. Although the performance will significantly decrease after 1 or 2 years.CAMERA : It's Average due to it's camera software optimization. But with GCAM, It can Outperform many mobiles in this Price segment.BATTERY : performance is super. It can easily last one day for heavy users( yt,fb,insta ) with 1 hour of gaming( codm ).CHARGING speed is like 0-100 in 1:40 hour. My mobile charged from 23-93% in 65 minutes. People usually charge their mobiles from around 20%. So, the charging speed is better.BUILD QUALITY is better than expected. In comparison, the build quality is better than poco m2. DESIGN is very stylish.MY OPINION is this mobile is an ALL ROUNDER. It is THE BEST in 12000 rs price segment untill now. This MY REDMI NOTE 10 review.. Hope this review helped you........\"},\n",

       "  'Review': 'I must say that I am pretty impressed with this phone. I am also the owner of a Samsung s20fe. And I have done a side by side comparison of the display and I was hard-pressed to find any difference.  The display is that good. The refresh rate thing I cannot really understand.  120hz vs 60 hz are almost the same for daily usage. Speakers are good but the right speaker is louder. Loudness is average. S20 fe has way better and louder,Full sounding and  more balanced stereo speakers.I am not a gamer . The cameras are excellent although  there is no video stabilization like the higher end s20 fe .The side mounted finger print scanner is far better and more convenient that an indisplay fingerprint scanner. I simply cannot understand the hype of indisplay scanners. They are slow and you need to double tap the screen or set the screen to wake up mode which is irritating and buggy. Side mounted finger print scanner is the best scanner implementation in my opinion it is simply superfast and unbeatable.Performance is butter smooth for day to day usages and battery is very good ..charging speed is average .Phone feels thin and vulnerable  to damage . Mi ui is a little buggy ..it keeps asking me to complete setup etc.Google dialer in note 10  has pathetic sound recorder it gives a warning message and recording quality is subpar . Samsung fe has an excellent sound recorder and an auto sound recorder with no warning tones or messages . Also it is Ip 68 waterproof ...that is a huge advantage ...At 12000 rupees the phone is the best deal and it gives you 90 percent of the features of a flagship device for a non gamer. After this price point the rule of diminishing  returns kicks in at an exponential  rate.I have also owned a redmi note 4 and I must say this note 10 is way beyond in every aspect.  The display is comparable to flagships and the camera is excellent too. Over for 12 k this phone is super excellent 👌'},\n",

The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy\"},\n",

Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details.

However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide\\'s sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0\" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren\\'t many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that\\'s pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can\\'t see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.'},\n",

I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down.\"},\n",

The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that.\"},\n",

But, if you select 48MP and took a photo, it is very good.Charging - Super fast, it took less than an hr from 20% - full charge.Weight - When you have case on it, you will feel something we are holding. Of-course every mobile will weigh, when you put the case on it.Performance - Since 2 days I am using it, it's really fast and want to observe more to write about it more.Display - it's large and very clear. Its an edge-to-edge screen and even we can change the settings of display to reduce the display size.Overall, if you are looking for best phone under 12K INR, blindly you can go for it.\"},\n",

By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ℅ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10℅ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100℅.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.☹️\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.\"},\n",

I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks\"},\n",
