Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement.

He was facing issues with this phone from the first day, but he didn't inform me since I gave him a gift and didn't feel like complaining about a gift. It's only after I met him I came to know that :1. This phone has serious heating issues. Gets so much hot while charging that a human hand can't hold it.2. Battery Draining issue. The battery doesn't last more than 5 hours after 100% charge with normal to low usage. If you keep the phone and stare at the battery percentage, you can actually see it going down in front of your eyes.3. Overrated camera. The amount paid for this phone doesn't justify the quality of the cameras, and the entire thing is overrated.4. I would clearly recommend buying an iPhone 11 instead. Way better battery life, camera, durability and software experience.I tried returning the phone immediately, but amazon did not accept the return and asked us to run some tests. On running the test they advised that the phone is perfect and we might be not using it right. Beautiful isn't it? And now we are stuck with this worthless heating brick.\"},\n",

Battery backup is decent when you are using 120 Hz refresh rate. OS is very clean but you will not get many customised option as it is like a stock android. Call recording function is useless but it is privacy policy u can't blame OP for this.Camera is not as hyped by OP , hasselblad is ordinarily working. Still camera is good enough since last versions. May be future updates will do much better as hardware specifications are good enough. Front camera is ok type they must have given atleast IMX 586 in that. At this price, when u are getting SD 888 , very fast charging, Sony IMX 689 and 766 sensors, this price is good. But they should have given OIS, more 5G bands.People say that wireless charging should be given like in overseas versions. What is the use 15 watt or 30 watt wireless charging when you getting 65 watt charging. Wired charging is much quicker than wireless. So wireless charging under 30 watt will be worst.Vivo X60 or Pro may be better in terms of camera but still they are using SD 870 only. Just 33 watt charging. They are using Sony IMX 598 only.  Somewhere you are getting better but u can't beat this in terms of batter charging and performance.No heating issues I have faced when used this almost 3 hours. Design is ordinary dont look like a flagship, Color is good. Extremely light weight and handy to use.It is good to buy.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Hey .Today I'm gonna review the Oneplus 9 5G .Ask me any questions you have directly , and I'll try to answer them all. üôèOkay so let's start :The phone looks quite good , its thin but a bit less wide , I use an iPhone 12 Pro Max , and it's around 1-2 cm less wide . Not a big issue .Screen is fluid , no problems at all . I have used oneplus 7T so I've trust over this brand .Battery :The 65 watt charger does what it's meant to . The cable is a USB C To C . Not the old usb to C . Charges in around an hour .Camera :In my opinion , the biggest selling point is the camera here . Looks good , with a tinge of extra saturation . Way better than the older ones . Gives a lot of independence too .PUBG :ALot of people buy oneplus devices for games , and comparing to my iPhone , this device gives a good competition . 90 fps is an advantage over apple , but rarely devices give 90 fps , maybe in tdms but not in classics . No lag , but you will see some frame drops , but which device doesn't have frame drops ! Even the iPhone does .Competitors :I needed to purchase this for my mother , so Need to share why I went for this .There's IQOO , Asus and Oneplus in this range which are worth buying . I have been using one plus so I trust them more , they have a local service center too , something which I lack in my iPhone experience .I don't trust vivo much , IQOO is a developing brand , it's op for sure , but still couldn't gamble . The Oneplus gives better cameras than any other , which is the main reason I got this , as camera usage is a lot .People with similar budget with just gaming budget can go for rog , but if you need a family phone , this guy packs nearly everything .*You also get stickers and a red cable club card , which is something I like .CONS :Oneplus really needs to deal with the software issues . There's always some thing left to patch after the release , which sucks .The dialer has that annoying annoucement during recording , and that really can make you go deaf XDOverall , could go for rog if needed a gaming phone , but since a lot of my family members use this device , I went for one plus .Thanks for reading , I hope I helped you :)\"},\n",

If you're a moderate user you will get whole day backup.Oxygen OS is just amazing. It's the cleanest UI I've ever used and have lot of customization features too..No heating issue faced till now, it just became a little warm(very little) in booting. Other than that I played Asphalt 9 and COD mobile they were buttery smooth.Final rating from my side 9/10.

The phone heats up like crazy even with simple operations like a video call (even after the latest Software update).

I m writing this review after using it for 2 days.Received phone 1 day before promised date. I bought this phone at 51999‚Çπ with SBI credit card.Phone box contains phone with applied screen guard, back cover, charger and C to C cable for charger. You can't connect this phone to your laptop if you don't have C USB port in your laptop. You have to buy C to USB cable. Luckily I have one from my old phone.Phone is light is weight w.r.t. 7T pro which is a plus point for guy like me who carries the phone in front pocket. Also the screen size is appropriate, not too large and not too small.Phone is slim like one plus 6 and screen is flat and round at the edge like 7T pro. Front camera is not at centre, which I don't prefer.Battery looks good so far. Charging from 5% to 90% in 20min. I m using phone continually for last 2 days and I have to carge the phone twice. So I would say it's plus.I m not a game person but played game to check it's performance and found better than last phone.Cameras are really good. Both front and back camera are best. I m not a photographer but for amature like me it does job more then required.Cons for me:-1. No USB to C cable for laptop connection2. One plus phone app is not there, phone is using Google phone app, same goes with messaging app. Which is may be due to inbuilt Alexa.3. Heating of phone while charging and while using for long time, but that's what u expect when u have this much large battery.Overall really good phone within its price range with flagship brand.\"},\n",

For camera prefer the Pro bcs of OIS. OP9 has stabilisation mode but not that effective.

       "  'Review': 'So I have been using Oneplus 9 (8gb,128gb) model for a week now and here are my thoughts on it.Screen: The Display on this device is a excellent display and the colours are accurate and 120hz just makes it even better.Battery Life: Battery life is decent with 5.5-6 hours screen ontime usually but the catch here is the insanely fast charging, just 10 minutes of charging can increase battery % by 20% so I had no problems with the battery.Speakers: Speakers on this device are dual speakers and they are loud and clear.Cameras: This has become a controversial topic of this phone. In my opinion the cameras are fairly good during daylight but as soon as you go under artificial light the camera starts to struggle a bit. The Wide angle is my favourite of the 3 lens as it has the best white balance and good detail. It also takes micro shots. The main camera is also good when enough light is given to it. The selfie camera tho is the weakest of the bunch. I just would not recommend it for people who use a lot of selfie camera.Software: One of my favourite things about the phone is the software experience. OxygenOS is fast, smooth and very well optimised. This phone would be as good as it is without OxygenOS.Performance: Snapdragon 888 obviously is super Fast. No problems there.One thing that I observed was the phone heats up while using the camera but nothing significant.'},\n",

       "  'Review': 'Been using the phone forr about a week now and first of all i have to say that the hassaelblad branding on the phone is just for name sake.Yes they changed the camera app a little bit and made it in a way that it gives a look and feel of a hassaeldblad camera and thats about it.So dont expect too much from the camerars.Now coming to the rest of the phone its a really nice phonePros1.The 120hz amoled screen with 240hz touch sampling is really really smooth and looks really good2. The 65w warp charging is stupid fast 0 to 100 in about 35 minutes3. Perfromance is also really good tho even while using some casual stuff like browsing instagram the phone sometimes feel warm to touch.4.The stero speakers are really good5.Overall the user experience is good and really snappy6.Haptics on the phone is really goodCons.1.Even tho the phone isnt heating up , in apps like ampere , cpuz and even oneplus own oneplus care app it shows that the phone is overheating , hopefully they solve it soon2.The camera is over hyped with the hassaeldblad branding3. Since there is no OIS on the camera sometimes especially in low light if your hands arent steady the pictures comes out to be blurry.4.Battery life is just about okish but with the fast charger given in the box charging it is really fast5. The phone feels like its been rushed a little since there are a few bugs here and there in the software like the overheating bug i mentioned earlierOverall it is a good phone , if you are consedering to buy this phone take a look at the vivo x60 series too and make a choice'},\n",

       "  'Review': \"I had read many reviews about overheating and battery drain...did not face any such issues after a 494mb update pushed by Oneplus. The phone does get warm but it's definitely not overheating. Played pubg(smooth+extreme) on max brightness for an hour and phone peaked 39¬∞ celcius(in room temperature under fan) which is quite normal and nothing to worry about...lost around 25% battery but no issues there since the phone charges with unbelievable speed. The SD888 paired with buttery smooth Oxygen OS is brilliant. No lags, jitters in day to day use...the phone is absolute beast in terms of performance and speed. Not the best camera but still does the job for me and I'm satisfied with it. Plastic frame is not a deal breaker since almost everyone will use it with a case. OnePlus should have given aluminium frame and OIS in a device of this price range. Overall an amazing phone for performance, user interface and experience and battery charging speeds.

       "  'Review': \"My review after three months use:I am reducing it to one stars after three months use. Initially I gave five star. Reasons of giving one star is:1) the phone is over priced and it's actual price should be not more than 13-14K.2) occassionally it's back panel heats up.3) design is poor, especially at the back camera panel space above the flashlight is unutilized and don't look premium. Much cheaper mobile phones have better design.3) the whole body including screen, back panel and camera panel is very sensitive to scratches. You have to cover with phone case and screen guard immediately otherwise your phone will give a dirty look full if scrates after one week use.3) no IP rating. Forget water proofing, not a trace of water resistance. You have to prevent it from humidity and sweating.4) screen refresh rate is poor in comparison to other phones available below 10K range.Following was my review after almost one week use. __________________________________At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': 'Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage'},\n",

We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don\\'t get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don\\'t spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.'},\n",

I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average'},\n",

The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9.

       "  'Review': \"I have been using this from starting. Ordered on 18th sep and get this phone very next day 19th. Here is my overall review.1. Battery - tremendous and optimization is on next level2. Display - It's great display ever.3. Speed - faster then ever ( compared to my other phones )4. Gaming - Very powerful no laging ( played COD, Hitman Sniper, Asphalt 9)But wait, in the meantime I've faced some issues on the phone as well.1. Voice call - call is fine but when call is placed on speaker children voice could not be heard by other. On normal call it's perfect but on speaker it's not. Adult voice can be heard from a distance but children voice can't. even the phone is just near the face. This issue can lead you the problem while you're on whatsapp video call as well. First I thought it was just whatsapp issue but after certain test it's major issue on voice call. Tested with safe mode and also after factory reset (without any other third party applications)2. Fingerprint sensor - It's fine and fast. But wait. you need to setup both hands fingers so it's easy to use. Maybe if the finger print sensor placed on in-display then it's better than this but if you map with both hand fingers and thumb then it's easy. Other wise you've to wait for 30 seconds if the finger not matched for 5 times.3. Galaxy Apps - Disable it otherwise unnecessary apps and bloatware will be install automatically.4. Knox - It's displaying secured by Knox but secure folder is not there. Which should be.I have replaced the product but still the microphone issue is there so plz be carefull with this.\"},\n",

The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"Well, as compared to the same feature range phones. The price seems to be 2-3k high. But if you are bored of charging your phone every 6 hours, you have a relief here with 7000 mAh battery, which doesn't  disappoint you.  I choose primarily for the battery and it lived up to the point that it stated. With playing 1 hour of playing COD, using hotspot for a full day and browsing it lasted for more then 40 hours and there is a battery saver mode too, which will last for a week if you are travelling out and need to use phone for only call and minimum usage.But, if you are a non-stop gamer it will last a day depending on the usage.Pros:Display is good, performance is fine, battery is stand out. The camera is also good and bixby vision is cool. Many edited features come with the camera, that is added advantage. Sensors are good and fast too. The weight is well balanced, you won't feel the weight after a day's usage. Charging is quite quick. Rest of phone's features are fine.Cons:Plastic built body, no tempered glass or case is provided within the box. The speakers are located at the bottom which is uncomfortable if we hold the phone in two hands and watch videos or play games. In dark, the screen display may cause some burden to the eyes, which I did not face earlier. The background apps keeps running until you close them or optimize the battery which will automatically close all the background running appVerdict:Little high-priced, very good battery and a satisfactory performance.\"},\n",

       "  'Review': \"I have been using Samsung Phones ever since they ventured into Smart Phones. I had privilege of using majority of Samsung Phones like Galaxy S2, Samsung Grand, Samsung S6, Samsung S9+, Samsung Note 3 and Samsung S10.When Samsung launched M51, like many I think I am also fooled by aggressive marketing campaign and youtube reviews by youtubers like Technical Guruji (I unsubscribed his channel due to fraud review)Why I purchased this phone because ofBrand SamsungExpected Good Camera SetupExpected Good Build QualityExpected Good PackagingAnd for this I have paid good price of INR 25KWhy I am disappointedBuild quality is quite inferior it's cheap plastic that use to come in phones like Karbon or Lava in 2012-2013.Camera setup is quite average, they say it's triple camera but picture quality is not so great, night shots are average, I think if you buy brands like Xiaomi you get better pictures by spending less amount. Probably that's why Samsung is marketing Single Take feature, which I think won't work if camera is average.Packaging, after paying INR 25K one expects box to include stuff like Phone Cover as these days majority of manufacturers, but here it comes with cheap quality of Box, that has nothing but a cheap charger with very poor quality of packaging, now a days many manufacturers are also putting the screen protectors at cheap cost, Samsung should take a note.Phone weighs quite heavy and is not easy to use with one hand, this is something nobody is telling, probably thats the only reason Samsung has degraded the build quality.What is good about this phoneBattery - Certainly that's the only feature for which I paid INR 25K. But are you willing to pay this much for a phone that's more of power bank.Headphone Jack - Samsung has retained it, and it's output is pretty good.Apart from that phone has same processor like Samsung A80, which comes with better camera setup and better build quality.Therefore I feel Samsung is over charging customers for this device and it should not cost more then INR 15K - 18K.So if you are only looking for battery and headphone jack then spend money on this one and If anyone wants to contact me I am ready to resell mine at 20%  discount.I wish they had option of giving zero stars.Amazon I am sorry this is my worst ever Amazon shopping experience which I regret everyday when I see what I got.\"},\n",

I do not game heavily or photograph heavily.To me the best part about it is the display. I've never used an OLED display and moving from standard LCD to OLED is magical. The system wide dark mode support makes everything look sexy black!The battery is super powerful, although I've to use it for more days to give a better review. From what I experienced, you can easily get 12-15 hours of screentime at least, spanning over 2 days. The charging is as advertised, taking around 2 hours for a full charge.I'm not a camera enthusiast beyond some selfies and occasional landscape photography when I travel. The camera provided satisfied my expectations. Please look at same photographs attached, bearing in mind that light conditions were not optimal and I'm not an expert at the art. Also, it has Cam2 API support, so you can install a Google Camera mod and tweak the settings to your liking.This phone is worth it for the display and battery for me. It has everything I expected. Only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a cover or screenguard, while other manufacturers provide that even at this range.\"},\n",

Kudos to samsung)- Headphone jack is a boon ...although I use TWS but a headphone jack is a must.- Battery can be stretched more than 1.5 days with normal usage. But initially need to disable every background app to get optimized battery life.- Glastic back panel is shiny but will not give premium feel.- Fingerprint is decent but getting used to side mount will take time.- Not for osmo mobile 3 (which I have tested and also try to upload video) uncomfortable to load and unload.- Excellent camera and video esp macro- Selfie cam is also good- Requires some adaptor to charge old phones. Mi cable is good converter & charging cable for usb mini- Speaker is average- Bloatware is there but can be disabled ...- 6gm ram and snapdragon processor does the job efficiently.- No hapticsA nice decent phone from Samsung.Pro Tip : Never buy a phone on the basis of whats new always buy on the basis of what you need.

       "  'Review': \"I purchased it on 18 September on 12:01 pm with no delay as I wanted to buy this amazing phone by Samsung. Surprisingly  it was delivered on the same day within 6 hrs. Now I have used it for almost a week and can give my overview about the phone. I will provide you the main pros and cons of Samsung M51PROS:#SuperAmoledPLUSdisplay believe me it is one of the best display I have ever seen on mobiles. You will love the premium quality while watching video and seeing photographs infact reading on this mobile feels great.#Camera: Amazing camera quality it gives natural colors, dynamic contrast ratio is better than the phones come between the price range of 30 to 40 thousand. Daylight images are just magical. 64mp camera is just awesome. 12mp macro lense gives you amazing details. Wide angle for selfish lovers where you will get most of the function get works automatically. One take picture is just amazing too. I can say you will not get such camera performance  in other phones even if you choose any phone having price beyond 40000.#Battery: Believe me if you are a normal user your battery will not get ended before the third day. If you are moderate users of phone it will give you atleast 2 days of battery backup. And if you are a hard-core mobile user you will not able to drain this battery in one single day.#UserfriendlyOneUI: what a lovely UI, very smooth , no confusing icons, better placement of folders in my files. Categorization of items by samsung is awesome anyone can use this with no difficulty. Your pics, videos, recordings, documents  everything will be kept in right place and believe me it will make you so happy as you don't have to find anything here and there.#Snapdragon730G: what a great thing to have both thing in your phone one the brand Samsung and another the processor snapdragon. Yes this processor  made M51 a great choice. Snapdragon helps to improve your gaming performance plus it also helps in smooth functioning  of different apps. No lag while viewing videos, playing games and making calls.CONSLook these are my point of views may be the cons don't have any value for most of the users.#Size: The size of phone is 6.7inch which can be a bit big for many users especially having small hands. Besides, bike riders who use to go offices daily may find this phone challenging while keeping inside the jeans pocket.#Body: the body of phone is glastik and it is so scratchable that means you have to buy the backcover as soon as possible. Using backcover and tempered  glass is advisable. This is not a big cons as now a days we all use back cover in all phones so don't take it as negative one.Hope you will like the review and it will help you give you idea of purchasing the phone.\"},\n",

So this phone I tested for last 4 days and the battery stood for 3 days and 3rd day mid I had to charge the phone. Camera I felt is ok as I could see in full pixels as well the photos when zoomed are not able to capture full clarity images. But that is ok if one does not want to Zoom images and for budget phone you cant expect much as well. Close images are all great with back and front camera clicks. They could have provided earphones basic version with device during this pandemic situation as most of them are at home working and taking calls and use earphones which has become basic requirement. I purchased 256 additional memory card and its working great with the device for additional space. Its become my mini computer to store important documents, videos, music and applications. So I am enjoying my buy as of now with great battery life. I consciously did not buy any Chinese phones as you never know if service will be available in future once India decides to remove Chinese manufacturers slowly in years to come. Overall 5 star for Battery life which was my basic requirement.'},\n",

But we are a country where unsafe cheaper cars outsell safer built slightly higher priced cars.People compare this phone with Chinese brand counterparts and overlook the fact that their data and security are compromised.For what it's worth this phone comes with the Knox security which is an additional secure hardware, do the Chinese brands offer that?Others complain about its heft. It's lighter than iPhone 11 Pro Max. And it has a bigger battery.My only expectation from this phone is that it remains as snappy over the future updates.Sense UI is a lot better, Knox allows me to have a professional profile independent of personal one. Cameras (both front and rear) and battery are excellent, charging speed is really good. Audio quality, when earphones are plugged in, because of the Dolby Atmos, is phenomenal. Display is very good.

       "  'Review': \"Well first disclaimer - nothing is perfect in world, so is M51 (or for that matter any other phone). But M51 actually ticks all right boxes at given price. Let me give an honest and personal opinion. Before that let me share that I bought this phone for my college going son. I'm a Note user since last 3yrs, so would be a candid review.Best things :1. Battery - With more and more screen time, you need a reliable battery life. 7k battery gives you excellent juice to do more without draining soon. Charging is fast so far. No heating witnessed.2. Screen - Samsun screens are no doubt the best ones. Super Amoled used here is treat to eyes.3. Camera - truly truly marvellous. I can't just believe the camera department in M51. Sony hardware is well oiled and you get crystal crisp pictures. Amazing pic quality.4. Weight to me is not that bulky given a big screen and bigger battery you need to run that for 2 days, unplugged.Improvement areas :1. Dolby atmos is excellent in headphones but stock speaker could have been better, though not disappointing.2. There are no headphone, cover and screen guard in the box. All that are well informed earlier, so least surprises. Negligible costs and many good options available in market. BTW I use Spigen case and super awesome on M51. very very secure.All in all a very good phone, ticks all compartments right. Go for it w/o thoughts. And the best things, Non Chinese brand. Samsung has come up with one of the largest mobile plant at Noida in India. So another right tick.\"},\n",

I found that its Camera is good for casual photogaphy with good low light performance,it is the same camera which comes with M31s and i think most of the persons will like its performance..2. It is packed with 7000 mah battery and will last uptp 2 days with moderate use (not heavy gaming)....3. Samumg One UI is awesome with some preloaded application and it also comes with knox security which gives hassle free experience and peace of mind and it is specially optimised for this to work with Snapdragon 730g(although it is cut down variant of One UI which samsung only gives in its flagship phones and A series)..4. Now for the very first time after 2-3 years samsung fixed a Snapdragon processor in its phone and earlier it was giving same old exynos 9611 in most of its phones....it comes with a Snapdragon 730g processor with an antutu score of approx 270k and geekbench score of approx 1700 and performance wise it is very good and one can easily play pubg in ultra settings with 35-40 fps and with 8 gb ram it works blazingly fast and makes multi tasking easier....5.It comes with a 6.7\" AMOLED plus infinity-O full HD display and only downside is that it doesn\\'t comes with Gorilla glass 5 protection and is only 60hz display other competitors give 90hz display with Gorilla glass 5 at the same price...Cons:1. It is made up of only plastic and is susceptible to damage if handled roughly and the side of the phone and even buttons are fully plastic atleast they should have given aluminium finish on buttons and on its sides..2.It has a toned down version of One UI so if someone wants to enjoy its full features then he has to look for A series...and this phone also comes with some bloatwares and also automatically starts downloading recommended application from galaxy store without user permission as soon as it connects internet....3.I think it is priced 1500-2000/-‚Çπ over its real price and which gives chinese phones an edge over it in terms of pricing..4.The phone only comes with an adapter only 25 watts and a type c to c charging cable...i think samsung has tried to cut the cost wherever possible..i think it could have been better if samsung supplied this phone with a back cover and pre applied screen guard with atleast 30 watt charging adapter...Vivo,realme,Oppo etc.all are giving the things that i have mentioned above at the price less than this phone...5.A 90 hz display with Gorilla glass 5 protection could have been better fit for this phone so one should buy a rugged back cover and a decent tempered glass to avoid any damage.....Now i have to say that it is a good phone but it is overpriced and most the of the persons will prefer realme,oppo,vivo etc. But if anyone wants a non chinese phone with a good better User experience then they should definitely look at this phone....'},\n",

And I didn't miss 90hz refresh rate!5. Camera - Not much testing with the cam yet. But the selfie cam seems quite interesting. Has great details.6. Battery - Its just 2days but I can see the enormous potential here. Got awesome 9+ hours of SOT on first charge despite all that app download n sync with accounts.7. Network - No issues here. Better internet speed and coverage than my last phone for sure. Call connectivity feels good till nowWill update further by the end of this week.Do comment your questions here if any.\"},\n",

Then what  when others are providing Gorilla Glass 5 front and Back.. This Samsung is giving plastic back, which easily get scratches and least bothered of phone maintainance. Atleast they could have provided back cover worth of Rs.50/- which is absense. Samsung is so harsh on customer paying 25k for his phone. This will not run for long. We don't brother buying Chinese phone if this attitude continues. Indian need to think. Chinese mobile companies manufacturing mobiles in India.. Also they are giving jobs to our people and many families are running.Why should be bothered, one who doesn't care of their customers.\"},\n",

It does look better than a sAMOLED display. Brilliant contrast and dark mode just looks beautiful.Camera:Looks promising. Decent pics for the price range. The front camera can give you a digital wide angle, though it does not have a wide angle lens. Software is excellent. Cmon guys, its a Samsung phone.Performance:It has a 730G and it ain't a slouch. No lags. Played COD Mobile at Very high graphics and max frames. There is a nominal heat dissipation after an hour of gaming. Not too intensive.Battery:This is where I was quite surprised. I expected to end my day with Atleast 65% left as my previous realme 2 Pro which has less than half of 7000 mah ended the day with 25-30%. But, though I use dark mode(Which is better for the battery since its an AMOLED display), I ended it with around 45-50%, which actually disappointed me. Hopefully, a software update will fix this.Less highlighting cons:The power button fingerprint scanner isn't quite fast( When compared to my previous realme 2 Pro) and is sometimes buggy..Verdict:It's an awesome phone. These features are unique. It can be your next phone. üòÅ\"},\n",

LTD.)  had turned out to be dysfunctional. I've been juggling between Amazon customer support and Samsung customer support since last 4 days to get this resolved.Amazon customer support refuses to help since it is out of 7 days replacement window and directs this issue to the OEM.OEM says that amazon is fooling me because there is a 10 days replacement window.OEM On-call & Chat support tells me that they 14 days replacement window and asks me to go down to the service center to get it replaced. Upon reaching the service center they tell me that they can't replace an online purchased device & amazon is liable to change until 10 days of purchase(as per amazon it is 7 days). The service center head refused to give this statement in written. Now, either don't trust AMAZON and it's seller or don't trust the Brand and Manufacturer at all.Now, who is to blamed for all the nuisance? Who is feeling cheated? And guess what, brand loyalty goes for a toss!!!Why OnePlus, Apple have good brand loyalty & advocacy, because of good devices & even better customer support.\"},\n",

The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.'},\n",

       "  'Rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars',\n",
       "  'Review': 'After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)'},\n",

       "  'Review': \"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.\"},\n",

Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.\"},\n",

But the excitement quickly died down as soon as I saw the screen. There is a warm greenish tint to it which makes the colors off.Selfie portraits aren‚Äôt good either. Too sharp for portraits. May be I should have gone for the 12 Pro Max as it handles much better because of the telephoto lens.Hope apple fixes the screen issues soon'},\n",

       "  'Review': 'Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap.'},\n",

The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.One problem I encountered is that  the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn‚Äôt have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price.'},\n",

If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.\"},\n",
